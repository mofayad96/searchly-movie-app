# 🎬 Searchly - Your Movie Discovery Companion

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **Searchly**, a beautiful and modern movie search app that I built with React and Vite. This isn't just another movie app - it's a visual feast with smooth animations, glass morphism effects, and a user experience that'll make you want to discover new films all day long!

## ✨ What Makes Searchly Special

- **Eye-Catching Design**: Animated gradients that shift and flow like a living background
- **Glass Morphism Magic**: Translucent cards that blur the line between UI and art
- **Buttery Smooth Animations**: Every hover, click, and transition feels natural
- **Smart Search**: Find movies, TV shows, and actors with lightning speed
- **Mobile-First**: Looks gorgeous on your phone, tablet, or desktop
- **Real Movie Data**: Powered by the OMDB API for accurate, up-to-date information

## 🚀 Getting Started (Super Easy!)

## 🎨 The Visual Magic

### Animated Background
The background isn't static - it's alive! Watch as gradients shift from purple to blue to pink, creating a mesmerizing effect that's easy on the eyes.

### Glass Morphism Cards
Each movie card has that trendy glass effect with backdrop blur. It's like looking through a frosted window - modern and elegant.

### Hover Effects
Hover over anything and watch it come to life! Cards lift up, buttons glow, and everything feels responsive and interactive.

### Loading States
Even the loading animations are beautiful - multi-ring spinners and smooth transitions that make waiting feel good.

Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or desktop, Searchly adapts perfectly:
- **Desktop**: Full grid layout with all the bells and whistles
